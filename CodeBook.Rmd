The TidyData.txt is cleaned and proccessed data from the UCI HAR Dataset.

The tidy data set returned is a dataframe with 68 variables (columns) and 180 observations (rows). 

Each row corrosponds to a subject (1,2,17, etc) and activity (walking etc) and the means of various variables of interest.

The variables of interest were chosen from the original data by filtering by the strings "mean()" and "std()".

Each variable corrosponds to an average of a mean or a standard distribution. For example:

tBodyGyroMeanY - in the time domain, the mean of the BodyGyro in the Y dimension.

All the variables (other than subject and activity) are normalised on [-1,1].

See the original README.txt in the UCI HAR Dataset for more information on the experiment design and data methodolgy.
